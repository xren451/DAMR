# DAMRï¼šDynamic Adjacency Matrix Representation Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation
This repository contains the code and datasets for the paper "Dynamic Adjacency Matrix Representation Learning for Multivariate Time Series Imputation". In this paper, we propose a new imputation method based on graph neural network architecture.

we design DAMR that extracts various dynamic patterns of spatial correlations and represents them as adjacency matrices. The adjacency matrices are then aggregated and fed into a well-designed graph representation learning layer for predicting the missing values.
